# Quadrilateral-Maths
Quadrilateral area, angle and side calculator. Details- When we run the code a square with default side 400 is displayed on the screen. By mouse monitoring the user can change each vertex to point anywhere on the screen. Then finally area, length and angle of the final formed quadrilateral will be displayed on the screen .I have used Java and Java SWing in this project.
